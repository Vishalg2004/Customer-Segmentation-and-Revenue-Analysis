# Customer-Segmentation-and-Revenue-Analysis
This project explores customer shopping patterns across different malls to understand consumer behavior and sales performance. It uses a large dataset of transactions to analyze how factors like age and gender influence what people buy and how much they spend. The included Power BI dashboard provides a visual way to track revenue trends and see which product categories are the most successful. By examining these shopping habits and payment preferences, the project highlights key areas where a business can grow and better serve its customers. It serves as a complete example of how raw data can be turned into clear and useful business insights.
